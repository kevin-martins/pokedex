# Pokedex

The purpose of this project was to fetch a web API an to parse through it taking wanted information for a front-end display.
When lauching, you'll have to wait till the programme takes all informations from the API server.
I store them into an object to quicken the answer from the front-end actions and prevent all the future calls to the API server .
When loading finished, input field and button type filter will be revealed and the images of every Pokemons will be displayed.

# Input field
The input fields purpose is to search a pokemon through the pokemon's list shown bellow.
No need to submit the answer, it will search after each changes.

# Button selection
The button here works as a filter. Each representing an pokemon's element type like (fire, water, grass, rock, etc...).
Selecting a filter element will display every pokemon which has at least one of its type.
